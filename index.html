            been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had
            an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
            and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
            12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encouraged tenroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entircurriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
            very hands-on and I never had to wait long foassistance. The agile
            team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
            the next level in way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
            I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an examplof my
            developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
            full-stack developer aftereceiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
